Strengths,Weaknesses
"•	Already-existing expertise on low-carbon and high efficiency products (e.g. proprietary low CO2 intensity clinker)
•	Close collaboration with policy makers on current and future regulations
•	Strong risk assessment/mitigation tools (e.g. Aqueduct tool for water scarcity and carbon footprint tool)
•	Higher relative consumption of renewable energy usage
•	Leading role in the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI)
•	Use of an internal carbon price ($30)
•	Strong focus on biodiversity protection through partnerships
•	Robust monitoring of emissions and great improvement in emissions level","•	Higher per unit CO2 emissions than industry leaders
•	History of controversies and lawsuits: nearly 40 environmental fines with a total volume of almost $600k
•	No plant-level CO2 reduction master plan and no long-term targets (check out slide 10 of this link for HeidelbergCement)
•	Poor waste/water management strategy
•	No external/internal environmental audits
•	Occurrence of environmental incidents (1 major, 37 moderate and 238 minor in 2018)
•	No target to reduce their water usage
•	Only implement sustainability initiatives when forced to by regulation (e.g. in Europe but not in the US/Mexico – except for air quality regulation)
•	Long-term deal with big polluting companies (e.g. PEMEX petroleum company for petcoke until 2022-23)"
Opportunities,Threats
"•	Legal regulations (e.g. water scarcity or energy efficiency in some areas where they are operating)
•	Technology advancement on carbon capture and storage
•	Increased low-carbon and specific product demand (e.g. lightweight concrete or fibre reinforced)
•	Sustainable cement as a climate adaptation solution (cope with climate change impact)
•	Potential revenue streams from selling recyclable materials (e.g. to transport infrastructure companies)","•	Implementation of a carbon tax (e.g. on fossil fuels in Colombia and Mexico, already affecting their operational costs, mainly related to transport) and ETS (European Union, California, Mexico)
•	Increased compliance surveillance, leading to greater litigation and penalties risks/costs
•	Disruption in their supply chain from physical risks (e.g. extreme events such as tropical cyclones or flooding) and chronic physical risks (e.g. rising sea levels, water scarcity affecting their sources of pet coke, slags and fly ash) "
